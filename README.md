## Functionalities:
    
    Standard calculator built in React language, mainly using the useReducer Hook, used to make the code shorter and cleaner and also 
    easier to maintain.

    This project is the result of several functions that avoid, mainly using validations, problems such as:
        1- Enter more than one 0 when starting typing;
       
        2- Add two or more '.' in a row on the calculator screen, which makes no sense in its operation;
        
        3- It is possible to change the operation just by clicking on another symbol referring to some mathematical 
        operation (+, -, /, *), as in calculators;
        
        4- After completing a mathematical operation, when typing another number, it resets the old value and shows the 
        new value entered;
        
        5- The '=' key clears the old value from the calculator;
        
        6- Number has correct division every 3 decimal places, even if it is float;
